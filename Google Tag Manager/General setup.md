# Intro
This document contains general suggestions for optimal **Google Tag Manager** setup.

## General preparations
Optionally make a separated Google Chrome profile. 
Very handy when working for different agencies at the same time.
Allows to have separated logged in Google profiles and separate sets of extensions at the same time.

Use LastPass or a similar extension to manage passwords. You can use separate instances across different browser profiles, but there's little need to do so unless you're being forced by your agency/client.

## In-browser setup

1. Adblockers off.
2. Adswerve - dataLayer Inspector: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adswerve-datalayer-inspec/kmcbdogdandhihllalknlcjfpdjcleom
3. EditThisCookie or a similar extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en
4. Allow both extensions to work in Incognito.

There are a lot more plugins for debugging. But more is not better. Adswerve is very good and removes the need for many other debugging tools.
