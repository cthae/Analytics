# Intro
This document contains general suggestions for optimal **Tealium** setup.

## General preparations
Optionally make a separated Google Chrome profile. 
Very handy when working for different agencies at the same time.
Allows to have separated logged in Google profiles and separate sets of extensions at the same time.

Use LastPass or a similar extension to manage passwords. You can use separate instances across different browser profiles, but there's little need to do so unless you're being forced by your employer.

## In-browser setup

1. Adblockers off.
2. Tealium Tools: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tealium-tools/gidnphnamcemailggkemcgclnjeeokaa
3. EditThisCookie or a similar extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en
4. Tealium Data Layer Debugger: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tealium-data-layer-debugg/aegehiegfbndemonfanncbgdfafpfabm?hl=en
5. Something to debug actual events unless you prefer the Network tab. I suggest `Adswerve - dataLayer Inspector for GA` for GA debugging and `Debugger for Adobe Analytics` for AA debugging.
6. Allow all extensions to work in Incognito.
